#Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
The DriverPass project was focused on creating a system that helps users study for and schedule their driver’s license tests. The client was DriverPass, a company that wanted a user-friendly online platform where customers could register, log in, access study materials, and schedule their tests. They wanted the system to make the entire process faster and more accessible for users, improving their chances of passing.

#What did you do particularly well?
I feel that I did a strong job identifying and organizing the client's requirements clearly. The business requirements document was detailed but still easy to follow, and the system design document clearly mapped out the functionality. I also made sure the diagrams were straightforward so someone new to the project could understand the overall flow quickly.

#If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
If I could revise one part of my work, I would spend more time on the visuals in the system design document. I would add a little more detail to the diagrams to better show the relationship between different parts of the system, like how the confirmation emails trigger account activation. Adding more labels would have made it even easier to follow.

#How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
I interpreted the user’s needs by first focusing on the goals they wanted to achieve: register easily, access study materials, schedule a test, and pass the exam. I broke down each action into steps a user would naturally take and made sure the design supported those actions without unnecessary complexity. It's critical to focus on user needs because if the system doesn't match what users actually want to do, they’ll either get frustrated or leave altogether. A good system should feel intuitive.

#How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
When designing software, I like to start by deeply understanding what the user is trying to accomplish. I usually sketch out rough workflows first and then move into more detailed diagrams. In the future, I plan to use even more user stories and personas to stay centered on the real-world user experience. I also want to make a habit of getting early feedback from mockups or prototypes before finalizing the design.
